# PluralCrypt

A tool for decrypting Pluralsight videos downloaded from the Pluralsight Offline Player.
This is a fork of https://github.com/mrvogiacu/Decrypt-PluralSight-Videos-GUI.

# Getting Started

* This tool requires .Net Core `3.1`.

# Installing

* Download the latest binary from [here](https://github.com/sitiom/PluralCrypt/releases/latest).
* Extract the zip file in a folder and run the executable.

# How to use

1. Select the course path and DB file. Default Pluralsight path is `%LOCALAPPDATA%\AppData\Local\Pluralsight\courses`.
2. After selecting the output path, select `Read course`.
3. Select the courses to decrypt or press the `Select all` button.
4. After selecting your preferred options, `Run` and wait for the decryption process to finish.

**Notes:**
+ Please don't remove the course from POP before decrypt. You can check the Delete checkbox to remove the course after the course decrypted.
+ You can delete all courses by selecting all courses, checking the `Delete` checkbox only, `Run`.
+ Some courses don't have subtitles, so the subtitle file will not be generated.
